              worked on both frontend and backend tasks.

                My exposure to frontend work in this role was almost entirely
                through a project where I wrote a Reusable Modal component for
                the companies front-end library.
              </ListItem>
              <ListItem>
                This modal in behavior and design is similar to what is
                available in popular front-end libraries such as Mantine (what

              </ListItem>
              <ListItem>
                The work mostly involved refactoring message handlers in

              The picture below might be a little small. It is a presentation I
              made on the research topic that my team and I were working on. The
              gist of it is to analyze LLVM Intermediate Representation to make
              provably correct micropatches for systems software where
              documentation is limited and source code might be inaccessible and
              or failure is unacceptable. For example, code running on
              government satellites or critical infrastructure.

              I unfortunately only got to work on this project for around 8
              months as the PhD student I was working under had to take leave
              from the program for personal reasons and there was no longer
              anyone for me to work with after. The PhD student I worked under,
              Mia Kelly, was also great and really helped me learn a lot.
